# OutlookMeetingShortcut
- Finds meeting links in appointment body and provides a shortcut to open them.
- Adds a small button in the ribbon to open a meeting link (teams or zoom) found in the appointment's body. If it's a zoom link, it will show you the description in a nice little box so you can get the password easily too.

## Using
Download the release on the right hand side, and double click to install it. Uninstall in "add or remove programs" application because this type of addon is just quirky and funny.

Or compile it with visual studio.
